The ixi lang live coding environment is a simple visual system presenting a high entry-level control over synth definitions and samples in SuperCollider. The core idea is to represent events in a spatial layout, thus merging musical code and musical scores. The score is active, i.e., if a method is performed upon the score, it changes in real time.

Download SuperCollider first and then install ixi lang.

If you are new to all this, you might just want to download the ixi lang.app from here: http://www.ixi-audio.net/ixilang, but if you are brave and want to use ixi lang with SuperCollider, here are the basic instructions:

SuperCollider is here:
http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/

ixi lang is here:
https://github.com/ixiaudio/ixilang

You need the SC3plugins from here:
http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/ (choose the Universal Binary)

And finally the ixiViews classes (for the MIDIKeyboard)
https://github.com/ixi-thor/ixiViews


1) Put SuperCollider somewhere on your system.
2) Start SuperCollider.
3) You will now have a SuperCollider folder within your "~/Library/Application Support/" folder.
4) Create an "Extensions" folder in there and drop the ixilang and ixiViews classes into that folder.
5) Drag the SC3plugins folder into the "Extensions" folder as well.
6) Quit and start SuperCollider again and boot the server that is "default" (you can choose either).
7) Open a new SC document (Apple+N), type "XiiLang()" in it, and evaluate that line (highlight it and hit SHIFT+RETURN (buttons pressed in that order))
8) Now explore the instructions of ixi lang in the XiiLang.html helpfile.

That's it!
